## Description ##

Shows a list of all the registered post types in your install of WordPress. [Russell](https://github.com/KrashKartMedia) has a [similar plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-all-the-post-types/), and once I started fixing some things in it, I decided my vision for the plugin might not merged cleanly in, so I figued I'd make a fork.

## Installation ##

### Manual Installation ###

1. Upload the entire `/registered-post-types` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate Query All The Post Types through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
